# 🚪 **Logout Button Guide - FIXED!**

## ✅ **Logout is Now Working Perfectly!**

The logout button has been fixed and now correctly redirects to the login page as requested.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Custom Logout View**: Created a custom logout function that handles both GET and POST requests
2. **Direct Redirect**: Updated JavaScript to use direct redirect instead of form submission
3. **Proper URL Configuration**: Ensured logout URL redirects to `/api/account/login-page/`

## 🎯 **How to Use Logout Button:**

### **Step 1: Find Your Name**
- Look at the **top-right corner** of your dashboard
- You'll see your name (like "Utsab Acharya") with a **downward arrow** ▼

### **Step 2: Click Your Name**
- **Click on your name** in the top-right corner
- This opens a dropdown menu

### **Step 3: Click Logout**
- In the dropdown menu, you'll see:
  - "Profile Settings" 
  - **"Logout"** ← **Click this!**

### **Step 4: Confirm Logout**
- A beautiful confirmation modal appears
- Click the **"Logout"** button in the modal

### **Step 5: Automatic Redirect**
- ✅ **All data is cleared** (tokens, session)
- ✅ **Fast redirect to login page** (`/api/account/login-page/`)
- ✅ **You're now logged out!**
