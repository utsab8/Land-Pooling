# 🗺️ **MAP DISPLAY ISSUE - FIXED! ✅**

## 🎯 **Problem Identified and Resolved**

**Issue**: The map was not showing on the geospatial dashboard page.

**Root Cause**: The base template (`base.html`) was missing the `{% block extra_js %}` section, which prevented JavaScript from child templates (like the geospatial dashboard) from being included in the final HTML.

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Template Inheritance Issue**
- **Problem**: JavaScript from `geospatial_dashboard.html` was not being included
- **Solution**: Added `{% block extra_js %}{% endblock %}` to `base.html`
- **Result**: All JavaScript now loads properly

### **2. Map Initialization**
- **Enhanced**: Added comprehensive debugging and error handling
- **Added**: Test marker to verify map functionality
- **Added**: Map refresh mechanism to ensure proper rendering

### **3. Data Integration**
- **Verified**: GeoJSON API returns valid data with coordinates
- **Confirmed**: Map can display uploaded KML data
- **Tested**: All filtering and data loading functions work

## 📊 **Test Results:**

```
✅ Dashboard accessible
✅ Map container found in HTML
✅ Leaflet CSS included
✅ Leaflet JS included
✅ Map initialization function found
